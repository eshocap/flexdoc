# Flexdoc Product Catalogue API

At Flexdoc, we're building more than just a lending service. We're creating tools for the next generation of property buyers, brokers, and AI assistants.

This public product catalogue API gives transparent, structured access to lending policies across our panel of lenders. It‚Äôs live, always up to date, and open for trusted partners and agents integrating smarter property lending workflows.

We believe lending policies shouldn‚Äôt live in PDFs or sit behind portals. Our API brings clarity and speed, helping you act faster and make better decisions.
